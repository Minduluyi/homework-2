                            Yulngu is a website designed to meet the needs of clients who have 
                            Aboriginal Art to resell.

                            These clients have collected Aboriginal Art pieces over the years.
                            We have set up a collation program where clients can register their 
                            art for sale. They must first become members on the Yulngu Fine Art Gallery website
                            which enable them to arrange a 30,60 or 90 day agency agreement for us to sell their 
                            art pieces online.
