                            Yulngu Fine Art Gallery is a website designed to meet the needs of Artists and clients where the gallery
                            acts as broker to represent local artists and those clients who have art for sale.
                            

                            These clients have collected Aboriginal Art pieces over the years.
                            We have set up a collation program where clients can register their 
                            art for sale. They must first become members on the Yulngu Fine Art Gallery website
                            which enable them to arrange a 30,60 or 90 day agency agreement for us to sell their 
                            art pieces online.
